# PricePulse--eBay-Price-Tracker

## Overview
The **eBay Price Tracker** is a Python-based automation tool designed to scrape product data from eBay, monitor prices, and send notifications via email and SMS when prices drop below a specified threshold. This project is useful for bargain hunters, resellers, and anyone looking to automate eBay price monitoring.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Web Scraping**
   - Uses Selenium to scrape product data dynamically, including prices and links.
   - Handles price ranges and skips invalid data.

2. **Notification System**
   - **SMS Alerts**: Sends price drop notifications via Twilio.
   - **Email Notifications**: Delivers detailed alerts to the userâ€™s email using SMTP.

3. **User Input**
   - Allows users to specify:
     - Product keywords to search for.
     - Price thresholds for alerts.
     - Phone numbers for SMS notifications.
     - Email addresses for notifications.

4. **Anti-Detection**
   - Rotates User-Agent strings to reduce the risk of being blocked by eBay.

5. **Batched Notifications**
   - Consolidates multiple alerts into a single email or SMS for efficiency.
